# Smart Telescope Prototype 2024 #

## Overview ##

This is a personal project that I worked on over the summer. Its objective is to replace 
my current telescope mount with a motorized version that is capable of tracking and 
targeting celectial bodies. I also want it to avoid as much of the manual calibration as
possible that is inharent in many comersially available smart telescope designs. This 
first design was a proof-of concept prototype, where I wanted to prove ____- things:

<ol>
    <li>Suspension mounts must be able to hold up the weight of the rover, which interfaces at two 0.5in shoulder bolts (value 30kg total)</li>
</ol>

## Design Requirements ##

<ol>
    <li>Suspension mounts must be able to hold up the weight of the rover, which interfaces at two 0.5in shoulder bolts (value 30kg total)</li>
    <li>The arm mount must withstand the loading from the arm, carrying a 5kg weight at full extension. (value 90Nm)</li>
    <li>Provide an enclosed space for electronics that allows for easy removal of the electrical core.</li>
    <li>Provide integrated panel mounts to run wiring to different parts of the rover.</li>
    <li>Provide mounting for the onboard lab.</li>
    <li>Provide mounting for cameras.</li>
</ol>
