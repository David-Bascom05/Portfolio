# Smart Telescope Prototype 2025 #

## Overview ##

This is a personal project that I worked on over the summer. Its objective is to replace 
my current telescope mount with a motorized version that is capable of tracking and 
targeting celectial bodies. I also want it to avoid as much of the manual calibration as
possible that is inharent in many comersially available smart telescope designs. This 
first design is meant to be a functional prototype. It is mechanically as simple as possible,
using belt drive and very simple 3D prints with internal steel reinforcment. The electronics 
stack is also simple, utilizing a raspberry pi for control and an arduino as a senor input 
board. This settup allows me to develope and iterate on software that I can test on a working 
stand. I plan to make future versions of this that are more mechanically advanced with custom
electronics to reduce complexity and mounting space.
