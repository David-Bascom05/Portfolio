# Rover Chassis #

## Overview ##

This project was done as a part of the Cornell Mars Rover project team. 
Its objective was to create a rigid and dourable frame that would eliminate
the complex and difficult to manufacture CNC joints that had been used in 
previous years. In order to acomplish this, I taught myself sheet metal CAD 
and design, and did a full redesign of the frame in sheet metal.
