# Rover Chassis 2022#

## Overview ##

This project was done as a part of the Cornell Mars Rover project team. 
Its objective was to create a rigid and dourable frame that would eliminate
the complex and difficult to manufacture CNC joints that had been used in 
previous years. In order to acomplish this, I taught myself sheet metal CAD 
and design, and did a full redesign of the frame in sheet metal. this was an 
ambitous departure from all previous designs, and allowed for much easier 
manufactoring, and reduction in weight, fewer overall parts, and vastly 
increased mounting space both inside and outside the frame. 

On the left is the old design, and on the right my updated design in sheet 
metal.

## Design Requirements ##

<ol>
    <li>Suspension mounts must be able to hold up the weight of the rover, which interfaces at two 0.5in shoulder bolts.</li>
    <li>The arm mount must withstand the loading from the arm, carrying a 5kg weight at full extension.</li>
    <li>Provide an enclosed space for electronics that allows for easy removal of the electrical core.</li>
    <li>Provide integrated panel mounts to run wiring to different parts of the rover.</li>
    <li>Provide mounting for the onboard lab.</li>
    <li>Provide mounting for cameras.</li>
</ol>
