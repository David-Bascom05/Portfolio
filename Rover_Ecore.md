# Ecore #

## Overview ##

This project was done as a part of the Cornell Mars Rover project team. Its objective was to
simplify the electronics bay of the rover, and make the wire roughting for the rover easier 
to manage. To acomplish this, I completely restuctured how the ecore itself functioned, 
changing it form basically a box encloser to a revoable power distrabution unit, with built 
in wire roghting, and made it fully removable from the frame for easier maintience.
