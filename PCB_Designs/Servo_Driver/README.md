# Servo Driver V1.0 #

# Overview #

The goal of this project is to create a custom servo driver that can controll a large 
number of servos independantly and comunicate over canfd. This was not designed with 
a particular project in mind, but more as an addaptable board that I could use in any 
project where I needed to be able to control a servo.

## Design Requirements ##

<ol>
    <li>Suspension mounts must be able to hold up the weight of the rover, which interfaces at two 0.5in shoulder bolts (value 30kg total)</li>
    <li>The arm mount must withstand the loading from the arm, carrying a 5kg weight at full extension. (value 90Nm)</li>
    <li>Provide an enclosed space for electronics that allows for easy removal of the electrical core.</li>
    <li>Provide integrated panel mounts to run wiring to different parts of the rover.</li>
    <li>Provide mounting for the onboard lab.</li>
    <li>Provide mounting for cameras.</li>
</ol>
