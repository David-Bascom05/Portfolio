This board was designed as a way of homing robotic actuators. The idea is that
one of these can be mounted on the output of an actuator that does not know its
starting position. It can then go though a homing sequence, and when a magnet 
passes over the sensor, it can detect that, and send the change of state back 
to the driver.
