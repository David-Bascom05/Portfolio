# Carbon Fiber Molding 2023 #

## Overview ##

This project was done as a part of the Cornell Mars Rover project team. Its objective was to 
create a replacement for CNC Aluminum parts out of carbon fiber. I developed a way of molding 
solid carbon fiber parts in complex geometries using 3D printed molds.
